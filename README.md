# Neural-network-from-scratch
Neural Network from scratch using easy to understand python Object Oriented Programming

Goal of this project is to implement Multilayer Neural Network from scratch using numpy and python OOP.
This project only uses the sigmoid activation function. 
Want to add more activation functions to this project.

an object of class Neural network is created using numpy arrays x and y as input.
each column of x represents one training example. and each column of y is the corresponding output(one hot encoded).
i have used two datasets for traing which i have attached.
